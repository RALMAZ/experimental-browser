Develop an extremely minimalistic browser using latest stable Electron and Vue3  
TypeScript is welcome but not required  
Optionally Pinia can be used for state management  
App should be able to:  
Add and close tabs with ability to switch between them  
It should be possible to reload tabs and go back and forth in tab's history, tabs should display current url or title (feel free to come up with your own behaviour)  
It should be possible to manually input a url (optionally open any search engine of your choice when input is not url-like)  
Browser window should be resizable and tabs' content should also resize when window is being resized  
Feel free to use any electron project templates, styling solutions, etc.  
Any extra browser features are welcome but not required  
```
